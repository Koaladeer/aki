#### Tasks
- [ ] API Hook  for Alpaca Historical Data
- [ ] API Hook for Clinicaltrials.gov
- [ ] Search for a Model to use with scienceOS Alternativ: test own ideas

- [ ] Clean Data
- [ ] Make ML Model
- [ ] WIN!

## General description and goal of the project
This project aims to explore the relationship between pharmaceutical clinical trials and stock market performance. We use clinical trial data from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) and stock price data from the [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/equities/bayer-ag-historical-data) to develop a model that can predict the stock performance of pharmaceutical companies based on their clinical trial activities.

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict short-term price movements of pharma stocks based on clinical trial outcomes, milestones, and other related data.

## Summary and results across experiments
TODO:

- **Experiment 1** focused on using past clinical trial success/failure data and basic stock price movement trends to predict short-term price changes.
- **Experiment 2** expanded the dataset by incorporating additional features

### Research
This project aims to explore the relationship between pharmaceutical clinical trials and stock market performance. 

The relationship between pharmaceutical clinical trials and stock market performance is significant. Clinical trial announcements, especially those with positive outcomes, can lead to increased stock prices for pharmaceutical companies. For instance, positive trial results often result in a median cumulative abnormal return of 0.8% on the announcement day, while negative results can lead to a decrease of 2.0% [Hwang, 2013].

The impact varies by trial phase and disease type, but generally, the market reacts more strongly to negative news than positive [Singh, 2022]. Additionally, the stock market's response to clinical trial announcements can be influenced by factors such as the company's drug portfolio size and the network effect of related events [Budennyy, 2022].

During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine trial announcements significantly boosted stock market performance, reflecting investor optimism [Chan, 2021]. Overall, clinical trial outcomes are critical events that can substantially affect a company's market valuation.

## Experiment 1
TODO:
### Data
- **Clinical trial data**: Sourced from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov). This includes information such as trial phases, enrollment numbers, and outcomes (success/failure).
- **Stock data**: Historical stock price data of pharmaceutical companies was obtained from the Alpaca API. The stock data was adjusted for splits and dividends.
